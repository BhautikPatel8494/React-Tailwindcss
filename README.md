## Tech Stack And Routes

In this task i have used react, react-router and tailwindcss
For the demo i have try to use mix of css and tailwind in future that can be modified by only tailwind that't not an issue but here for the test task i have added both

In this project we have 3 routes which are:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000): It's Home route
This route is usig pure CSS classes

[http://localhost:3000/recent](http://localhost:3000/recent): It's recent item route
This route is usig pure CSS classes and also the tailwind classes

[http://localhost:3000/overview](http://localhost:3000/overview): It's Home route
This route is usig only tailwind classes

Please review the code and let me know your though's for the same, If we only need to use tailwind then here i will update all code with tailwind classes but for the testing purpose only i have added both in this project
